# Proposal

## 1 Background & Set UP:

### TASKED With: Identifying a Good Engineering Problem

Based off the provided Scenario & Stakes

    The Project Manager at _Awesome New Startup, Inc._ has **secured an entire sprint to focus on creating utilities that enhance the development team's workflow**. During sprint planning, the **team identified areas of improvement** together. Each team member will be responsible for **taking ownership over one problem** this sprint.

    The entire software suite will be presented and discussed during the sprint retrospective. Furthermore, the suite of tools will be available internally for company-wide usage. A presentation will be made to everyone, introducing each tool, and a feedback form will also be sent in the organization's #general channel. **_That means all eyes are on you!_** You recognize an opportunity to **identify and solve a unique problem**, and are highly motivated to earn the respect of the entire organization.

**Reflect upon the questions below**, and **brainstorm ideas** that fit this scenario.

* What do you **wish was easier**?
* What utility, API, or library could **have the most impact on your day to day life**?
* What can I automate that would make **myself and others more productive**?
* How could you make your colleagues' day more **fun, interesting, or relevant**?
* When can the **unique features of Golang be applied** in order to **produce a polished product quickly**?

    _Example 1_: _Could use you `goroutines` to download a bunch of GitHub repositories concurrently?_ \
    _Example 2_: _Could you import a well-written Open Source package or API that grabs data from Google Sheets and returns it as a secured JSON API?_

### With the Guidelines of:

1. **Must score higher than `70%` to pass the project**.
2. **Consult the [syllabus](https://make-school-courses.github.io/BEW-2.5-Strongly-Typed-Languages/#/)** for **project due dates** and rules surrounding the **total number and velocity of commits** in projects and assignments.
3. **Copy this document** and commit it to your project's repository.
   1. **Use the ‚úì column to keep track of requirements you've completed** so far.
   2. **‚úì each section** of the rubric **upon completion** to keep track of your score.
   3. **This technique will ensure delivery of a passing, portfolio-worthy project**.
4. Items **marked with üåü** will earn you **bonus points**.
   1. You may **choose to complete any, all, or none** of the **bonus challenges**.
   2. Projects **scoring `>95%`** will **earn a limited-edition holographic [droxey](https://github.com/droxey) sticker** at the end of the term!
5. Instructor **feedback will appear in the empty space below** the rubric and **distributed at the end of the term**.
